# Boxplot

## Description

The boxplot (also known as a box and whisker plot) uses boxes and lines to show the distributions of one or more groups of numeric data based on a 5-point summary of data points: the upper extreme (“maximum”), upper quartile (Q3), median, lower quartile(Q1), and lower extreme (minimum) values. Through these five values, the boxplot provides information regarding the variability and skewness of the distribution. Box limits indicate the range of the central 50% of the data, with a central line marking the median value. Lines extend from each box to capture the range of the remaining data, with dots placed past the line edges to indicate outliers.

## When to use

Boxplots are used to show distributions of numeric data values, especially when you want to compare them between multiple groups. They are built to provide high-level information at a glance, offering general information about a dataset’s symmetry, skew, variance, and outliers. They allow for a comparison of data from different categories for easier, more effective decision-making.

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/distribution/boxplot_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Order the groups when they don’t have inherent order (for example, sorting groups by median).
2. Use horizontal boxplot when there are a lot of groups to plot, or if the group names are long.
3. Avoid using boxplots if you want to show the distribution in only one group. A histogram is recommended in this case.
