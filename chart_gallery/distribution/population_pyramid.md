# Population pyramid

## Description

A population pyramid consists of two histograms, one for each gender (conventionally, males on the left and females on the right) where the population numbers are shown horizontally (X-axis) and the age vertically (Y-axis). The values can be displayed either as a percentage of the total population or as a raw number.

## When to use

Population pyramids are the most effective visualization to analyze changes or differences in population groups. From the population pyramid, information about the population broken down by age and sex can be identified, which can also lead to other aspects of the population.
