# Pie chart

## Description

A pie chart shows how a total amount is divided between different categorical variables as a circle divided into proportional segments. Each categorical value corresponds with a single slice of the circle, and each arc length indicates the proportion of each category.

## When to use

Pie charts are best used for making part-to-whole comparisons with discrete or continuous data. The primary objective of a pie chart should be to compare each group’s contribution to the whole, as opposed to comparing groups to each other. If the above points are not satisfied, the pie chart is not appropriate, and a different plot type should be used instead. Furthermore, they only work well with a small number of slices, so they have a fairly narrow use case.
