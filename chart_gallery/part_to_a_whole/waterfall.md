# Waterfall

## Description

A waterfall chart shows how an initial value is affected by a series of intermediate positive or negative values. It is also known as a bridge chart, cascade chart, flying bricks chart, or Mario chart. Conventionally, the initial, intermediate, and final values are shown as floating columns. 

## When to use

A waterfall chart is useful for understanding the gradual transition in the quantitative value of an entity that is subject to incremental changes. It can be used for various types of quantitative analysis, ranging from inventory analysis to performance analysis.

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/part_to_a_whole/waterfall_dosdonts_1.svg --->

1. Colour the floating columns properly to  distinguish diverging values (e.g. green for positive values, red for negative values).
2. Connect columns with dotted lines.
3. Label the values exactly.
