# 100% stacked Column chart

## Description

100% stacked column charts are similar to stacked column charts in that categories are represented as vertical bars and series as components of those bars. However, in a 100% stacked column chart, each series bar represents the percentage of the whole to which it belongs, where the total (cumulative) of each stacked bar always equals 100%. Can be a good alternative to [pie charts](#link-to-piechart).

## When to use

100% stacked column charts can not be used for part-to-whole comparisons like pie charts but can be used to show the relative percentage of multiple data series such as how proportions change over time.
