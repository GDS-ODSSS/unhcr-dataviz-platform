# Donut chart

## Description

The donut chart is a variation of a [pie charts](#link-to-piechart), with the total amount divided into categories based on a proportional value. For the most part, there aren’t significant differences between a pie chart and a donut chart, so the choice of a donut over a standard circle is mostly aesthetic. One small advantage for the ring shape is that the central area can be used to show additional information such as the total amount figure. As with pie charts, donut charts can only display a small number of slices before becoming confusing

## When to use

Donut charts are used for the same purpose as pie charts, to make part-to-whole comparisons. Donut charts are more space-efficient than pie charts because the blank space inside a donut chart can be used to display information inside it.
