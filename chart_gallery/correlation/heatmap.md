# Heatmap

## Description

A heatmap is a type of visualization that values are depicted through variations in colour within a two-dimensional matrix of cells. It allows us to visualize complex data and understand it at a glance.

## When to use

Heatmaps are useful for visualizing variance across multiple variables to show patterns in correlations. 

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/correlation/heatmap_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use an appropriate colour palette to match the data: use a sequential palette to differentiate high values from low values; use a diverging palette when a reference value is in the middle of the data range such as zero.
2. Include a legend to support the understanding of the chart.
3. Include values in cells for static versions, when the fine differences between variables are important.
