# Venn diagram

## Description

A Venn diagram (or set diagram) is a type of diagram that displays overlapping shapes (typically circles) to illustrate all possible logical relationships between two or more sets of items. The area of overlap is known as the area of intersection. This is where items are in common between the sets.

## When to use

Venn diagrams are widely used in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and business to show relationships between multiple sets. It is an effective way to organize things graphically, and highlight how the items are similar and different.
