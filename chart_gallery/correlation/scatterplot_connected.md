# Connectd scatterplot

## Description

A connected scatterplot is a type of visualization that displays the evolution of a series of data points that are connected by straight line segments. In some cases, it is not the most intuitive to read; but it is impressive for storytelling.

## When to use

A connected scatterplot is often used to show a trend in data and the relationship between two variables over intervals of time. It has similar functionality as the line chart, except data points of connected scatterplot are highlighted with markers (dots). Spend more time on the design (a well-designed connected scatterplot can be a powerful tool for storytelling).

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/correlation/scatterplot_connected_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use an arrow line to indicate the direction of evolution when a third ordered variable (very often time) is assigned.
2. Use an appropriate measurement interval.
3. Don’t plot too many data series.
