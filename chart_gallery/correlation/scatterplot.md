# Scatterplot

## Description

A scatterplot is a type of visualization using Cartesian Coordinates to display two variables for a set of data. The data are displayed as a collection of dots. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates the values for an individual data point.

## When to use

Scatterplots are commonly used to observe the relationship or correlation between two numeric variables. The relationships between variables can be described in many ways: positive or negative, strong or weak, linear or nonlinear. In a scatterplot, we can not only see the values through individual data points but also patterns when the data are taken as a whole.

Typically, a scatterplot displays only two numeric variables, however additional variables can also be displayed by assigning values through colour (categorical variable), size (numeric variable), and animation (time series variable).

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/correlation/scatterplot_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Avoid overplotting (when lots of data points overlap each other, relationships between variables will not be easy to identify).
2. If overplotting can’t be avoided, use transparency to help the reading.
3. Don’t interpret correlation as causation.
4. To help the analysis you could add a regression line.
