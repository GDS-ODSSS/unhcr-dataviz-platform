# Tree diagram

## Description

A tree diagram is a graphical representation that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. The diagram has connecting lines extending from a root node, a member that has no superior/parent. Then the connecting lines (also called “branches”) link other nodes together to show the relationship between the members. Finally, there are the leaf nodes (also called “end-nodes”) being the members with no further extensions.

## When to use

Tree diagrams are often used to display organizational hierarchy such as organization charts which give clear information on reporting lines and structure. They can also be used to show family relations and descent (known as a “family tree”).

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/correlation/tree_diagram_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use simple shapes such as rectangles or circles as nodes.
2. Use consistent colours throughout the chart.
3. Build the diagram from the root node from top to bottom or from left to right.
4. Each node can only have one connection in the hierarchy to the top (except the root node).
