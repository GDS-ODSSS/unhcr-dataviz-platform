# Bubble chart

## Description

A bubble chart displays multi-dimensional data in a two-dimensional plot. It can be considered as a variation of the scatterplot, in which the dots are replaced with bubbles. However, unlike a scatterplot which has only two variables defined by the X and Y axis, on a bubble chart each data point (bubble) can be assigned with a third variable (by size of bubble) and a fourth variable (by colour of bubble). Furthermore, a fifth variable (usually, time) can also be assigned by animating the data variables changing over time.

## When to use

A bubble chart is primarily used to compare and show the relationships between numeric variables, by the use of positioning and proportions. It allows the analysis of patterns or correlations of a given data set.

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/correlation/bubble_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Try to limit the number of points to plot.
2. Draw bubbles with transparency.
3. Use legend and/or interactivity (by clicking or hovering over bubble) to improve readability and understanding of the chart.
4. Don’t draw the size of the circle based on its radius or diameter; use the circle’s area instead.
