# Ordered column chart

## Description

An ordered column chart is a chart in which each category is represented by a vertical rectangle, with the height of the rectangle being ordered and proportional to the values being plotted. 

## When to use

An ordered column is widely used to display the rank of each category being plotted. It’s an alternative to the ordered column chart when the category name is long.

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/ranking/column_ordered_dosdonts_1.svg --->

1. Order values in descending order.
2. Always start with a zero baseline.
3. Use horizontal labels to improve readability.
4. Use consistent colours throughout the chart, accent colours can be used to highlight meaningful data points.
5. Space between bars should be roughly half of the bar width.
