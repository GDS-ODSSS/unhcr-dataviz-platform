# Lollipop chart

## Description

As a variant of the bar/column chart, the lollipop chart consists of lines and dots at the end to highlight the values. Like a bar chart, a lollipop chart is used to compare categorical data.

## When to use

A lollipop chart is used when there is a large number of categorical data to show and compare. It can be used as an alternative to bar/column charts. It should be used only when the fine difference between values is not important. This is because the exact value is at the middle of the dot which can be difficult to identify. 

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/ranking/lollipop_dosdonts_1.svg --->

1. Always start with a zero baseline.
2. Use horizontal labels to improve readability.
3. Use consistent colours throughout the chart, using accent colours to highlight meaningful data points.
4. Use a horizontal lollipop chart when the category name is long.
