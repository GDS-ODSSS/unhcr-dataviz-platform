# Column chart

## Description

In a column chart, each category is represented by a vertical rectangle, with the height of the rectangle being proportional to the values being plotted. It’s a vertical version of the [bar chart](#link-bar-chart), also sometimes called a vertical bar chart.

## When to use

The column chart is widely used to show comparison among categories and sometimes to visualize time-based data. It’s effective for showing the difference between values.

## Dos and don’ts

1. Always start at a zero baseline. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_dosdonts_1.svg --->
2. Use consistent colours throughout the chart, using accent colours to highlight meaningful data points. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_dosdonts_2.svg --->
3. Choose either axis label or data label. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_dosdonts_3.svg --->
4. Use horizontal labels to improve readability. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_dosdonts_4.svg --->
5. Space between bars should be roughly half of the bar width. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_dosdonts_5.svg --->
