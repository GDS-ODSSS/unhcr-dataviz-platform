# Bar chart

## Description

A bar chart is a chart in which each category is represented by a horizontal rectangle, with the length of the rectangle proportional to the values being plotted. The horizontal axis shows data value, and the vertical axis displays the categories being compared. It’s a horizontal version of the [column chart](#link-column-chart).

## When to use

The bar chart is widely used to show comparison among categories and sometimes to visualize time-based data. It’s effective for showing the difference between values. It’s an alternative to the [column chart](#link-column-chart) when the category name is long.

## Dos and don’ts

1. Always start at a zero baseline. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_1.svg --->
2. Use consistent colours throughout the chart, using accent colours to highlight meaningful data points. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_2.svg --->
3. Choose either axis label or data label. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_3.svg --->
4. Sort the data in descending order before charting for non-ordinal data. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_4.svg --->
5. Space between bars should be roughly half of the bar width. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_5.svg --->
6. Avoid using bar charts if most of the values are negative. It is better to use column charts unless the labels do not fit underneath the bars. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_dosdonts_6.svg --->
