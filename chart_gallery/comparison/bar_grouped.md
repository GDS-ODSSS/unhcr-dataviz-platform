# Grouped bar chart

## Description

Grouped bar charts are a type of colour-coded bar chart that is used to represent and compare different categories of two or more groups.

## When to use

Grouped bar charts are used when two or more categories are grouped and arranged side-by-side. The grouped bars make it easy to interpret the differences inside a group, and even between the same category across groups. It’s an alternative to grouped column charts when the category names are long.

## Dos and don’ts

1. Always start at a zero baseline. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_grouped_dosdonts_1.svg --->
2. Order of the elements in a legend should be in the same sequence as the bars for easy reference. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_grouped_dosdonts_2.svg --->
3. Don’t plot more than 3 groups. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_grouped_dosdonts_3.svg --->
4. Leave enough space between two groups of bar charts in order to easily differentiate between the groups. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_grouped_dosdonts_4.svg --->
