# Stacked column chart

## Description

The stacked column chart stacks vertical bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the stacked bar shows the combined value of the groups. They show the cumulative values of a data item and compare parts to the whole.

## When to use

It’s particularly useful when comparing relative and absolute changes over time. However, stacked column charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped column charts are preferable. 

## Dos and don’ts

1. Always start at a zero baseline. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_stacked_dosdonts_1.svg --->
2. Elements in the legend should be in the same sequence as the bars. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_stacked_dosdonts_2.svg --->
3. Don’t stack too many groups at once (five or fewer is ideal). <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_stacked_dosdonts_3.svg --->
4. Use horizontal labels to improve readability. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_stacked_dosdonts_4.svg --->
5. Space between bars should be roughly half of the bar width. <!--- assets/img/comparison/column_stacked_dosdonts_5.svg --->
