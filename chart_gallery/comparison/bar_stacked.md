# Stacked bar chart

## Description

Stacked bar charts stack horizontal bars that represent different groups one after another. The length of the stacked bar shows the combined value of the groups. They show the cumulative values of data items and compare parts to the whole.

## When to use

Stacked bar charts are used to show how a larger group is divided into smaller subgroups and what the relationship of each part has on the total amount. It’s particularly useful when comparing relative and absolute differences across categories. It’s a better option when the category names are long and do not fit underneath of vertical stacked bar chart ([stacked column chart](#link-to-stacked-column))

## Dos and don’ts

1. Always start at a zero baseline. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_stacked_dosdonts_1.svg --->
2. Elements in the legend should be in the same sequence as the bars. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_stacked_dosdonts_2.svg --->
3. Don’t stack too many groups at once (five or fewer is ideal). <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_stacked_dosdonts_3.svg --->
4. The data should be sorted by total value in descending order when using a stacked bar chart for categorical variables (non ordinal variables). <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_stacked_dosdonts_4.svg --->
5. Space between bars should be roughly half of the bar width. <!--- assets/img/comparison/bar_stacked_dosdonts_5.svg --->
