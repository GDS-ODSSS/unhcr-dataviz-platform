# Sankey diagram

## Description

Sankey diagrams are a type of flow diagram that shows movement direction and flow quantity through arrows or lines. The width of the arrow or line shows magnitude; the thicker the arrow or line, the larger the quantity of flow. Flow arrows or lines can combine or separate their paths as they move along a process, and colours may be used to show different categories of movement or to divide different stages in a process.  

## When to use

Sankey Diagrams are commonly used to visually show the movement of population from one place to another, but they can also be used to show the flow of any isolated system process.

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/flow/sankey_diagram_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use distinct colours to group the entities into different categories, which helps in making comparisons and distinguishing groups.  
2. Apply transparency to the colours
3. Avoid using Sankey diagrams when the flows have similar values (widths) as it can make it difficult to differentiate and compare. If these comparisons are essential for your purpose, consider a (stacked) bar chart.
4. Keep it simple. Since not everyone is familiar with this visualization type, complex Sankey diagrams may require explanation. 
5. Minimise the number of crossing arcs by carefully ordering the groups on either side of the diagram.
