# Chord diagram

## Description

Chord diagrams visualize flows and relationships between multiple entities. Entities are arranged radially around a circle, with the relationships between them connected to each other using arcs. Values are assigned to each connection, which is represented proportionally by the size of each arc. 

## When to use

Chord diagrams can be used to show the flows and relationship between the datasets such as displacement of refugees from one country to another. Chord diagrams are eye-catching which makes them popular among different visualization types. However, they could become quickly cluttered and unreadable when visualizing larger datasets.

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/flow/chord_diagram_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Keep it simple. Since not everyone is familiar with this visualization type, complex chord diagrams may require explanation. 
2. Use distinct colours to group the entities into different categories, which helps in making comparisons and distinguishing groups.
3. Minimize the number of crossing arcs, by carefully ordering groups around the circle.  
4. Apply transparency to the colours.
