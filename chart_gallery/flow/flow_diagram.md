# Flow diagram

## Description

Flow charts show the sequential steps of a defined process. Flow charts can effectively simplify complex or abstract procedures for communication. The process is mapped out using connected symbols, such as arrows, indicating the direction of the next step. Boxes around steps sometimes use different shapes to differentiate the type of step. These symbols are standardized in order to make interpretation of these charts easier. Details of each step are written within the symbols to clarify and explain the process. 

## When to use

Flow charts are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. 

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/flow/flow_diagram_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Keep it simple and avoid complicated flow charts (one-page maximum).
2. Use consistent design elements (shapes, lines and texts) within a flowchart. 
3. Flow data from left to right.
