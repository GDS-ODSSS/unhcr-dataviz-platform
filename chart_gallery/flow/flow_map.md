# Flow map

## Description

Flow maps show the flow of objects from one geographical location to another and their quantity. The arrows show direction, while the width illustrates the quantity. This helps to show how objects move geographically.

## When to use

Flow maps are most frequently used to show the movement of population, but also animal migrations, money flow, the traffic of goods, etc.

1. Use curved lines to show movement instead of straight lines
2. ​​​​Use headed arrows
3. Make the arrows’ width proportional to flow rate
4. Make sure flows and arrowheads don’t overlap
