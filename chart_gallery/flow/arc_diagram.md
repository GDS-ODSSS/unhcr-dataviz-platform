# Arc diagram

## Description

Arc diagrams are two-dimensional informative network diagrams showing the connection and flow between entities (nodes). It consists of two elements i.e. nodes and links. Nodes represent the entities of the data. It is presented on a single horizontal line (a one-dimensional axis). Arcs are used as links intended to show flow or connection between the nodes. The width of the arc line and the size of nodes can be used to add further details such as quantity or frequency of connection or movement between entities.

## When to use

Arc Diagrams are ideal for visualizing networks, connections, and flow between different entities of information and the distribution of connections.
