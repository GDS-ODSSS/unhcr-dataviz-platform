# Choropleth map

## Description

A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned according to a data variable. The variable is categorized into intervals, with each interval represented by a colour, and the map filled accordingly. Colour progression is used to represent the differences, often blending from dark to light or one colour to another. The choropleth map provides an easy way to show how a measurement varies across a geographic area, or the level of variability within a region.

## When to use

Choropleth maps are great to show geographical patterns in the data. If the data doesn’t show a clear geographical pattern, consider another chart type for the data. Choropleth maps work best when geographic regions are fairly consistent in size. Otherwise, larger areas appear more emphasized, which could result in misinterpretation.

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/geospatial/choropleth_map_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Make sure to use normalized values (population per square kilometre) instead of raw data values (raw population figure) to show population density.
2. Make sure the legend is present.
3. Limit the steps of progression that are easily distinguishable by the human eye in order to make the map easy to read.
4. Don’t use choropleth maps for accurate comparison of the values.
5. Make sure to use the right colour scheme for your data, using a sequential colour scheme to drive the attention to higher values. Use a diverging scheme to drive the attention to both extremes of the scale.
