# Bubble map

## Description

As a variation of a [bubble chart](#link-to-bubble-chart), bubble maps display bubbles over geographical regions rather than the cartesian plane. The size or area of the bubble indicates the value of the particular variable, with the position on the map indicating location. Bubble maps are useful for comparing proportions against geographic regions without the issues caused by the size of different areas, as you would have in choropleth maps. 

## When to use

The bubble map can be effective when analyzing and comparing a particular variable by geographical location. For example, displaying the number of refugees by country of asylum on a bubble map can provide useful insights on international displacement.

## Dos and donâ€™ts <!--- assets/img/geospatial/bubble_map_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Avoid having too many bubbles overlap on the map, which will make the comparison between bubbles difficult. Grouping data ranges into specifically sized bubbles or tying with another chart type can be an alternative.
2. Apply transparency to the colour of bubbles.
3. Make sure the legend is present.
4. Make sure the size of bubbles is mapped to its area, not to its radius.
