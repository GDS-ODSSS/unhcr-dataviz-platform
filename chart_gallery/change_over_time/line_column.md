# Line column chart

## Description

A line column chart is a type of visualization that combines both line and column charts together, using dual axes displayed on the left and right sides of the chart. It allows us to show the relationship of two variables with different magnitudes and scales

## When to use

Line column charts can be useful when showing the relationship over time between an amount (column) and a rate (line). Be careful when using, because if used incorrectly, it can be misleading.  

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/line_column_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Place primary y-axis on the left
2. Start at zero baseline for y-axis that that shows the amount (column)
3. Don’t include too many variables
4. Use contrasting colours to clarify which data series belongs to which axis
5. Don’t use it to compare heights, as the axes could be on different scales
