# Streamgraph

## Description

A streamgraph is a variation of a stacked area chart. Instead of displaying values on top of a fixed, straight baseline at the bottom of the stack, the values of the streamgraph are displaced around a central baseline. This results in a flowing, organic-shaped “stream” displaying the change over time.

In a streamgraph, the horizontal axis is used for the timescale, while the height of each individual stream shape indicates the value of each category. Different colour shades are used for representing different categories. This makes streamgraphs visually appealing and more engaging to look at.

## When to use

Streamgraphs are useful for visualizing large datasets to show the quantity change within categories over time. It can help identify trends and patterns. Stream graphs are best used in an interactive form rather than static graphs.

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/streamgraph_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use contrasting colours for each individual category
2. Don’t apply opacity on colours for the filled areas
3. Don’t use a streamgraph to show fine differences between values
4. Make it interactive if possible
