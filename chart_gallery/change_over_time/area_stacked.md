# Stacked area chart

## Description

As a variation of a simple area chart, a stacked area chart displays the changes of value of multiple data series over a period of time. The values of each data series are plotted on top of each other, which allows tracking not only the evolution of total value but also the breakdown of that total by groups.

## When to use

Stacked area charts are useful for comparing multiple related variables changing over an interval. We can get a general idea of how each variable compares to the other in their contributions to the total. However, stack area charts should be used carefully as people could be confused with overlapping (or grouped) area charts in which all data series share a common baseline. 

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/area_stacked_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use a zero baseline for the y-axis
2. Use contrasting colours for each individual category
3. Don’t apply opacity on colours for the filled areas
4. Don’t use a stacked area chart to show fine differences between values
5. Order the values in a way that tells the best story
