# Area chart

## Description

An area chart, like a line chart, displays the evolution of numeric variables over a continuous period of time. However, in an area chart, the area between the line and x-axis is filled with colour or texture.

Area charts are created by plotting data points on a Cartesian coordinate grid (typically, timescale is on the x-axis, with values on the y-axis), and then the points are connected with a line, and the area below is filled.


## When to use

Area charts are useful for showing trending quantities, or even comparing multiple quantities against each other (also known as grouped or overlapping area charts).

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/area_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Use zero baseline for the y-axis
2. Use the same colour for the line and the fill
3. Don’t use an area chart for showing fine differences between values
