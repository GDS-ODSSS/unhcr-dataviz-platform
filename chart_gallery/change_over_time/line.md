# Line chart

## Description

A line chart is a type of chart that displays the evolution of one or several numeric variables over a continuous interval or time period. Typically, the x-axis is used for a timescale or a sequence of intervals, while the y-axis reports values across that progression.

## When to use

Line charts are common and effective for showing how the value of something changes over time or comparing how several things change over time relative to each other by plotting them on the same chart using different colored lines. 

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/line_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Choose an appropriate y-axis scale (ideally, the height of the line occupies roughly two-thirds of the chart area)
2. Don’t plot too many lines (four maximum)
3. Use solid and right weight line (thick enough to stand out against the gridline but still think enough to show the twists and turns of the line)
4. Use clearly differentiated colour for the different categories
5. Label the lines directly (use a legend only when space is tight)
6. Don’t use dual axes to compare the evolution of different variables (multiple lines)
