# Slope chart

## Description

A slope chart looks like a line chart, but unlike the line chart, it has only two data points for each line. The change between two data points can be easily identified with connected lines (slope up means increase, slope down means decrease).

## When to use

Slope charts can be used to show change in a ‘before and after’ story by comparing their values at different points in time. It is a great way to show change or difference when there are only two data points. It works well with both continuous data and categorical data.  

## Dos and don’ts <!--- assets/img/change_over_time/slope_dosdonts_X.svg --->

1. Don’t plot too many data series, especially if there are many similar values and slopes.
2. Use consistent colours throughout the chart, using accent colours to highlight meaningful data points.
3. Use direct labelling instead of a separate legend.
