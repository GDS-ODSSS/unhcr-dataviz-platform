          <h3 class="text-primary">Afghanistan today</h3>
          <p>With active combat largely ceased in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in 2021, the country is facing new challenges on its journey ahead after more than four decades of conflict. Nine in ten Afghans live in poverty, unemployment is soaring, and public services are insufficient to meet the needs of the people of Afghanistan. Women and girls have been all but erased from public life following a series of edicts issued restricting their social, economic and political rights in the aftermath of the Taliban takeover.</p>
          <p>As a result, UNHCR maintains a no returns policy for Afghan nationals in their countries of asylum. Any returns to Afghanistan must be voluntary in nature.</p>

          <h3 class="text-primary">Forced returns from Pakistan</h3>
          <p>In October 2023, the Government of Pakistan announced a new ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’, unveiling a scheme to expel all undocumented foreigners. The plan has disproportionately affected Afghans, many of whom have lived abroad for decades.</p>
          <div class="my-5">
            <h5>Cumulative returns from Pakistan to Afghanistan</h5>
            <div style="min-height:439px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1cN6a/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1cN6a/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
          </div>
          <p>In 2023, almost half a million Afghans returned from Pakistan. Of these, 28,000 were deported. However, the vast majority of the others should be considered as coerced, pressured and not fully voluntary. In interviews conducted by UNHCR at the border, Afghan returnees reported facing heightened risks of deportation, arrest, night raids, verbal and physical harassment, and being asked to leave Pakistan in the period leading up to returning.</p>
          <div class="my-5">

          <h3 class="text-primary">Challenges faced by returnees</h3>
          <p>With Afghanistan struggling to overcome the effects of decades of conflict, leading also to economic hardship and poor public services, uncertain futures await not only those who return but entire communities. Areas with large numbers of returns face high demands on limited local resources, placing strenuous demands on public services and local economies. UNHCR has been monitoring return trends and the situation facing returnees inside Afghanistan since 2002, allowing for the delivery of targeted assistance in areas experiencing high volumes of returns.</p>
          <div class="my-5">

          <p>Once back in Afghanistan, families will need to navigate a landscape where pervasive poverty and soaring unemployment pose significant hurdles to reintegration, coupled with impacts of climate change and extended periods of drought, and gaps in essential public services – including education, healthcare, and safe drinking water. Gaps in services has led to Afghanistan having one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world in 2023, while rural communities increasingly face rising levels of water scarcity fuelled by severe droughts. High rates of out-of-school children are being recorded as families deprioritize education to other needs in the face of poverty, and an estimated three out of four recent returnee households in rural areas do not have adequate housing.</p>
          <div class="p-4 bg-primary text-light mb-3">
            <p>Restrictions placed on women’s and girls’ participation in public life also contribute to their poor levels of information and access to essential public services, including education, healthcare, and employment as well as social support networks within the community, and have further compounded a rapid deterioration of their mental health situation. </p>

          <p>Many of the areas to which Afghans are returning are already hosting large numbers of internally displaced populations.</p>

          <p>It is important to remember that large numbers of Afghans are also forcibly returned from Iran.  UNHCR has monitored deportations from Iran since 2015. It is estimated that 3.8 million Afghans have been deported from Iran since 2015. An estimated 4.5 million Afghans remain in Iran.</p>
          <div class="my-5">

          <h3 class="text-primary">What UNHCR is doing?</h3>
          <p>To meet the protection and material needs of those forcibly returned in this challenging environment, UNHCR supports Afghans at the border and in their communities. Taking advantage of UNHCR’s 20 year history supporting Afghans to rebuild their lives and their country, the organization can leverage both its deep roots in the community and cutting edge technology.</p>
          <p><b>At the point of entry:</b> UNHCR and partners first meet returning Afghans at border crossing points, where they receive information and basic health services, before being referred to Encashment Centers run by UNHCR to receive full aid and protection packages.</p>
          <div class="my-5">
            <h5>Locations of entry points and UNHCR encashment centres</h5>

          </div>
          <p>Services include basic healthcare and vaccination, mental health and psychosocial services, mine awareness information, child friendly spaces and legal aid. Returnees also receive cash grants, ensuring that families can buy food and clothes, pay for transportation costs, and cover expenses of other immediate needs and services. UNHCR staff also work to identify, assist, and refer persons with specific needs or vulnerabilities, including unaccompanied and separated children, older persons, and women-headed households, among others, to ensure appropriate and tailored support is received as needed.</p>
          <p><b>In areas of return:</b> UNHCR’s assistance in areas of return is delivered through a ‘whole-of-community’ approach, improving access to basic services for the entire population, including services for women and children, civil documentation, education, healthcare, housing, water, and employment, among others. Working in over 80 areas of return, UNHCR initiatives include investments in education and healthcare services in communities where authorities are otherwise unable to provide these public goods to local populations. UNHCR is also building durable accommodation to support local infrastructure and community development, with housing structures designed to be earthquake resilient.</p>

          </div>

          <h3 class="text-primary">Robust data analysis and new technology</h3>
          <p>Humanitarian responders have frequently carried out assessments targeting returning Afghans to better understand the needs faced by families on their return. Thanks to these surveys, we know that returnees make use of social networks and assets acquired while abroad to assist their return and reintegration process.</p>
          <p>According to a desk review of currently available data on the most recent wave of returns in 2023, they are more likely to be families, with only 0.6% of crossings from Pakistan have been single individuals. Returnees also tend to be younger, with 56% under the age of 15. This means that most families returning now have more dependents than working members. Moreover, 94% have no education and 82% are low-skilled workers.</p>
          <p>This is echoed in 2023 UNHCR’s Socio-Economic and Protection Survey, revealing that returnees have lower employment rates than those that never left the country, with women the most affected by unemployment.</p>
          <div class="my-5">

          </div>
          <p>Interviews with Afghans returning from Pakistan at the border in 2023 have also disclosed high education gaps, with 70% of heads of households having no education. Moreover, 87% report to need housing assistance, 80% financial assistance, and 71% food aid in their final destinations in Afghanistan.</p>
          <div class="my-5">

          </div>
          <p>Interviews also reveal that 29% are single-woman headed households.</p>

          <h4>Can media monitoring help predict return movements?</h4>
          <p>While the idea that anti-Afghan sentiment contributes to discrimination against Afghans living abroad and that such rhetoric may lead to the decision of families to return prematurely is intuitive, it is difficult to prove. In an effort to examine ways to measure the impact of words, UNHCR has monitored social media to track rates of hateful discourse, the prominence of such statements, and compared it with timelines of deportations. Comparing the timelines of spikes in hateful discourse and deportation allows us to explore potential links between the two.</p>

          <p>Technology advances has also allowed UNHCR to monitor coverage of Afghanistan in traditional media. The graph below shows articles published in English speaking media relating to Afghan Returns from the announcement of and during the first phase of Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.</p>

                <p>In the initial days after the launch of the plan we see many articles categorising Afghans as illegal despite their many years of tolerated stay in the country, as well as attempts to link refugees to terrorist groups in Pakistan.

                <p>Towards the end of October we see two smaller spikes one in awareness raising, caused by an Afghan cricketer speaking out against the deportations, and one related to the Taliban, when the de facto authorities officially plea for host countries not to deport Afghans.</p>

          <h4>How AI plays a role in better understanding the needs of returning Afghans</h4>
          <p>During the most recent returns from Pakistan, UNHCR piloted a tool that captured needs and characteristics of households from structured conversations with returnee families. Survey outputs include descriptive and thematic analyses of the conversations, allowing UNHCR to better understand the experience of those returning and how to best help. This analysis is automatic, allowing UNHCR to keep an eye on how the perceptions of the returnees change over time.</p>

      </div>
      
          <p>Afghan returnees are in urgent need of help as their return to precarious futures poses daunting challenges. For women and girls, returns are especially difficult, as they return to an environment wherein their basic rights are being systematically eroded. Their return to Afghanistan places them in precariously vulnerable situations as they lose access to education beyond primary school, face critical barriers to employment and freedom of movement, and as these restrictions also increase risks of gender-based violence and other protection concerns.</p>
          <p>Inside Afghanistan, UNHCR is working as part of the Border Consortium to respond to the immediate needs of those returning. Our teams continue to work around the clock to support those arriving, to set up centres where families can rest, to provide access to healthcare, essential protection services and other emergency aid. Inland, our teams are also working in areas that welcome returnees home, where we invest in building resilient communities and durable solutions.</p>
