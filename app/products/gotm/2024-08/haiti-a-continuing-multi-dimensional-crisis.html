          <p>Indiscriminate gang violence in Haiti has led to an alarming escalation of human rights violations and large-scale internal displacement. Since 2021, gang violence against the Haitian population has spread from the capital, Port-au-Prince, to isolated rural areas. The pervasive violence includes sexual violence, kidnapping, looting, and roadblocks by armed gangs, along with an increasing number of attacks on hospitals, schools, places of worship, and other critical social infrastructure.</p>

                <p>A massive 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti killing more than 200,000 and displacing millions. Later that year, a cholera outbreak led to nearly 10,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands of infections.</p>

                <p>When Jovenel Moïse became President in 2016, his election faced accusations of fraud, leading to protests and political instability. The turmoil continued into July 2018 with large protests against Moïse over corruption, economic issues, and fuel shortages.</p>

                <h5>February</h5>
                <p>Haitian gangs, led by Jimmy "Barbecue" Chérizier, execute coordinated assaults in Port-au-Prince, to detain officials and obstructing Acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry's efforts to secure a UN-supported international security mission led by Kenya to combat gangs in the country.</p>
                <h5>March</h5>
                <p>Henry signs an agreement with Kenya to deploy 1,000 police officers to combat gang violence, However, the process is delayed by a court ruling that deemed the deployment is unconstitutional.</p>
                <p>Gangs in Haiti continue to escalate their attacks, storming two of the country's biggest prisons and freeing more than 4,000 inmates. In response, the Haitian Government declares a state of emergency.</p>
                <p>Amid growing calls for his resignation, Henry travels to Puerto Rico, announcing plans to step down once a transitional council is established. Amid growing calls for his resignation, Henry travels to Kenya to continue advocating for the Multi-national Security Support mission. He is unable to re-enter Haiti and travels instead to Puerto Rico, where he announces plans to resign once a transitional presidential council is established and an interim leader selected.</p>
                <h5>June</h5>
                <p>Haiti’s transitional council appoints a new cabinet on 11 June. On 26 June, Kenya's first contingent of 400 elite police officers landed in Port-au-Prince’s international airport after months of delay.</p>

          <p>The magnitude of the crisis is stark: almost half of Haiti’s 11.4 million civilians <a href="https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/haiti/haiti-humanitarian-needs-and-response-plan-executive-summary-january-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">require humanitarian assistance</a>. Gang violence and political instability have resulted in a record <a href="https://dtm.iom.int/haiti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">578,074 people internally displaced</a>, more than double the figure from 2022, making Haiti the country with the largest number of displacements globally due to <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/06/haiti-soaring-number-displaced-desperately-need-protection-and-aid-priority" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crime-related violence</a>. In 2024, UNHCR reported more than <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/global-trends-report-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">350,000 Haitian refugees and asylum-seekers worldwide</a>, with many undertaking dangerous journeys across the Americas and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p>Although there has been slow progress towards stability through the election of the Transitional Presidential Council and the recent arrival of the first contingent of Kenyan police officers as part of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/spotlight-on-haiti/mss-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multinational Security Support mission</a>, the crisis continues to grow. Without an end to the violence and more resources and access for aid agencies to continue to respond to the crisis, more people will be impacted and displaced.</p>
