          <p>Indiscriminate gang violence in Haiti has led to an alarming escalation of human rights violations and large-scale internal displacement. Since 2021, gang violence against the Haitian population has spread from the capital, Port-au-Prince, to isolated rural areas. The pervasive violence includes sexual violence, kidnapping, looting, and roadblocks by armed gangs, along with an increasing number of attacks on hospitals, schools, places of worship, and other critical social infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Haiti faced an escalation in gang violence, kidnappings, and general insecurity, worsened by the political void after President Jovenel Moïse's assassination, while Ariel Henry, as acting Prime Minister, struggled to conduct elections amid the persisting security turmoil.</p>

                <h5>January</h5>
                <p>After Haiti’s government fails to hold elections, citing unprecedented levels of gang violence, Haiti is stripped of its last democratically elected officials. Critics say it exacerbated democratic decay and turned the country into de-facto “dictatorship.”</p>

                <h4>2024</h4>
                <h5>February</h5>
                <p>Haitian gangs, led by Jimmy "Barbecue" Chérizier, executed coordinated assaults in Port-au-Prince, to detain officials and hinder PM Ariel Henry's efforts in Kenya advocating for a UN-supported international force against gangs.</p>
                <h5>March</h5>
                <p>Henry signs an agreement with Kenya to deploy 1,000 police officers to combat gang violence, a process delayed by a court that ruled the deployment is unconstitutional.</p>
                <p>Gangs in Haiti continue to carry out attacks, this time storming two of the country's biggest prisons and freeing more than 4,000 inmates. It prompts police to urgently appeal for help as they say security forces are overwhelmed. The Haitian Government declared a state of emergency, in response to increased gang activities.</p>
                <p>Amid calls for his resignation, Henry went to Puerto Rico. He later announced that he would resign once a transitional presidential council was put in place and an interim leader selected.</p>
                <h5>April</h5>
                <p>The Kenyan government suspends deployment to Haiti until a new government is formed. A deal for a temporary government, which would last until February 2026, is proposed on April 7. On 25 April, Ariel Henry resigned, and was replaced by the Transitional Presidential Council.</p>
                <h5>May</h5>
                <p>In the clashes between gangs and security forces three armoured vehicles of the police were destroyed and set on fire although gang violence began to diminish by late May. On 28 May, the transitional council appoints Garry Conille as the new Prime Minister.</p>
                <h5>June</h5>
                <p>Haiti’s transitional council appoints a new cabinet on 11 June. On 26 June, Kenya's first contingent of 400 elite police officers landed in Port-au-Prince’s international airport after months of delay. </p>

      <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
        <div class="col col-lg-8">
          <p>The magnitude of the crisis is stark: almost half of Haiti’s 11.4 million civilians require humanitarian assistance.  Gang violence and political instability have resulted in a record 578,074 people internally displaced , more than double the figure from 2022, making Haiti the country with the largest number of displacements globally due to crime-related violence . In 2024, UNHCR reported more than 350,000 Haitian refugees and asylum-seekers worldwide , with many  undertaking dangerous journeys across continental America and the Caribbean. </p>
          <p>Despite the severity of the crisis, funding for the humanitarian response in Haiti remains critically low. The Humanitarian Response Plan is currently less than 25 percent funded , which is grossly insufficient to address the severe needs. There is an urgent need for increased humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies, menstrual and maternal health products, and shelter.</p>
          <p>Although there has been slow progress towards stability through the election of the Transitional Presidential Council and the recent arrival of the first contingent of Kenyan police officers as part of the Multinational Security Support mission , the crisis continues to grow. Without an end to the violence and more resources and access for aid agencies to continue to respond to the crisis, more people will be impacted and displaced. </p>
