              <hr>
              <p class="fs-5">Beginning on 24 February, ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to a <b>massive refugee outflow</b> throughout Europe.</p>

            <p>The defining characteristic of this refugee movement is that <strong>the overwhelming majority of those fleeing are women and children</strong>. The age/sex breakdown of the entire Ukrainian refugee population is not possible due to the various countries involved and numerous cross border movements.  Nevertheless, every significant data collection exercise shows the same pattern.</p>
            <p>As an example, when looking at the 1.1M Ukrainian refugees who have registered for temporary protection (PESEL) in Poland, a full 48% are women over the age of 17.  Another 47% are children less than 18 years old. Nearly a third of these children are under six years old and therefore not able to attend school.   Almost half of the children under six are less than three and too young for even kindergarten or nursery.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In a separate exercise, 130,000 Ukrainian refugees have been enrolled for UNHCR cash assistance in Belarus, Moldova, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, and Poland.  Of these, 43% are working-aged women between the ages of 18 and 59.  Women comprise a staggering 89% of all working-age adults.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Women and children account for an unprecedented 95% of the recently-arrived refugee population from Ukraine in neighboring countries.  Effective access to child care and early education opportunities is unquestionably one of the most pressing needs facing refugee families, many of whom face prolonged separation from husbands and fathers.  Kindergartens in host communities are under enormous strain, while public child-care facilities are either non-existent or unable to respond to the existing needs of host communities.  Without access to childcare, refugee women will struggle to gain meaningful employment.</p>
            <p>Comprehensive childcare solutions should be accompanied by a set of more traditional socio-economic inclusion measures.  For this reason, UNHCR and the OECD launched <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/protection/livelihoods/5adde9904/engaging-employers-hiring-refugees-10-point-multi-stakeholder-action-plan.html" target="_blank">Engaging with employers in the hiring of refugees, A 10 point multi-stakeholder action plan</a>. It outlines a number of steps to be taken to ensure the inclusion of refugees in the workforce, including language courses, skills assessment, recognition and upskilling, information and counseling, job readiness courses, job matching, preparation of the workplace, creating evidence-base and a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach.</p>
