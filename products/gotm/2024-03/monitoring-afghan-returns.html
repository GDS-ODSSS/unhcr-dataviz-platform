          <h4>Returning Afghans; spontaneous, undocumented, or assisted</h4>
          <p>In October 2023 the government of Pakistan announced the “Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan” and subsequently implemented it in November 2023 which caused forcible return of nearly 0.5 million undocumented and registered Afghans. Among the registered Afghans, some had been in Pakistan as refugees for decades and were in possession of registration documents such as the Proof of Registration Cards, Asylum Certificates and Slips issued by UNHCR.  This is just the most recent development in a long history of displacement and return to Afghanistan. In 2016, due to shrinking protection space, nearly 400,000 refugees were returned to Afghanistan. UNHCR has worked to monitor and support returning Afghan since the turn of the millennium. Throughout this period, more than 6 million people have returned.</p>

          </div>
          
          <p>Today, as many as one in six Afghans may at some point have returned to the country. UNHCR first made this assessment in 2016 jointly with World Bank (UNHCR & WB 2016). The proportion is estimated to have dropped since.</p>

          <p>Afghan returns covers many kinds of returns, voluntary and assisted, spontaneous and deportees. In 2002 UNHCR began registering returns assisted through the voluntary repatriation programme including information on from and to where Afghans were returning. This allowed support services and assistance to be targeted to these areas and anticipate possible challenges to local absorption capacity. See the evolution below.</p>

          <p>Deportations from both Iran have been monitored since 2015 and by UNHCR since 2021 where monitoring was ramped up to also include deportation from Pakistan and other neighboring countries. It is estimated that more than 3,5 million have been deported from Iran since 2015 and 37,000 from Pakistan since 2021. With its border monitoring data, UNHCR can map the characteristics of deportees, and anticipate their specific needs that set them apart from other types of returns.</p>

          <h4>Who are the returning Afghans?</h4>
          <p>As these people crossed into Afghanistan, many were met by UNHCR and our partners and provided with assistance but are the needs and characteristics of these households the same as other Afghans.  Thanks to an increase in the number of households surveys targeting returning Afghans, we now know that returnees make use of networks and assets acquired while abroad. According to the Afghanistan Living Conditions Surveys in 2013-2014, returnees had higher literacy rates than their counter parts who did not move, with literacy rates amongst Afghans in Pakistan and Iran even higher, likely due to access to national education systems in their country of Asylum. Returnee households also had a lower rate of poverty than other Afghans. UNHCR mapped living conditions of Afghans in a similar fashion in 2023, allowing for comparison with condition pre-the Taliban take over for all Afghan’s including returnees.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>In 2019 and ?2022?, UNHCR conducted a survey amongst people in Afghanistan receiving livelihood support, amongst who a large proportion are returnees. Making use of this standardised tool we can visualise how the livelihood opportunities and income changed after the Taliban takeover.</p>

          <h4>Monitoring media, predicting movements?</h4>
          <p>That anti-Afghan sentiment contributes to increases in general discrimination leading to premature return or risk of deportation may intuitively make sense but it is hard to prove. How do you measure the impact of a choice of words? Monitoring of social media has allowed us to identify spikes in hateful discourse as well as the prominence of such statements. Hateful speech can be a consequence of high-profile media stories portraying Afghans negatively. Mapping prevalence of hate speech and deportations along the same timeline allows us to examine the link.</p>
          <p class="text-danger">TODO: graph deportations and hate speech</p>
          <p>UNHCR also monitors the media narrative in traditional media. Below timeline shows the prevalence of different narratives in the media over the cause of the Pakistan repatriation plan 2023. </p>

          <h4>Letting the machine do the work: AI-powered analyses of free text information</h4>
          <p>Returnees needs that differ from other Afghans, needs for shelter and a new livelihood as they may have assets left behind in the country of Asylum. UNHCR uses standardized surveys to determine needs of a population based on predefined categories of needs, but with recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, new opportunities are appearing which may make this work more efficient and effective. During the most recent repatriation plan, UNHCR piloted a tool to automatically capture needs and protection details from a free text description of the household’s situation. The result is a descriptive and thematic analysis of all these conversations.  It helps to summarize and prioritize the concerns raised by refugees.  In the end it allows UNHCR to better understand what refugees are experiencing and to help.  </p>
