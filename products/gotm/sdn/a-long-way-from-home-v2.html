          <p>In addition, <strong>more than 1 million people have arrived in the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Sudan</strong>. Of these five countries, Chad has welcomed the most refugees since the conflict erupted. 75 per cent of all who have fled across borders are refugees and asylum seekers and 25 percent are refugees who had been living in Sudan and now forced to return to their home countries prematurely.</p>
          <p>These numbers are staggering.</p>

          <p>Without urgent support and, ultimately, an end to the conflict, this grim milestone is expected to be surpassed as more people continue to flee.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-5">The crisis is continuing to grow</h3>
          <p>Some 1.7 million people have now fled Sudan – 1.2 million refugees, and nearly half a million returnees. Many of them have arrived to remote and insecure border areas, where the logistical challenges and cost of operating are enormous.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-5">An Acute Protection Crisis</h3>
          <h5 class="text-primary">Onward Movement – the crisis is spreading</h5>
          <p>The conflict that erupted in Sudan on April 15th 2023 triggered large scale displacement internally and outside the country with most individuals having no choice but leave Sudan. The protracted clashes has continued to cause massive displacement crisis, with millions of individuals fleeing violence and seeking refuge both within Sudan and across international borders. Many of these displaced persons become vulnerable to exploitation, extortion, attack, inhumane treatment, and abuse during their onward movements, particularly through involvement in smuggling and trafficking networks taking advantage of the chaos.</p>
          <p>Since the onset of the Sudan conflict, there has been significant onward movement  of over 50,000 registered asylum-seekers and refugees within the East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes region, and mass exile of mixed movement to North Africa and onwards to Europe through the Central and Western Mediterranean Sea, while others move towards the Horn of Africa, through Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti via Yemen towards the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
          <p>Since 15 April 2023, Sudanese refugees continue to arrive in Libya following the outbreak of conflict in Sudan. To date, UNHCR has registered 14,615 Sudanese citing their arrival in Libya to be on or after 15 April 2023. Additionally, 2,280 Sudanese individuals are awaiting registration with UNHCR Libya. They are coming directly from Sudan, through Chad, and through Egypt. And from Libya they are also moving. As per the latest UNHCR registration figures of January 2024, the number of refugees and asylum seekers registered with UNHCR in Tunisia has reached 14,371 individuals. Among current registered refugees and asylum seekers, 20% are children and youth and most come from Sudan (40%) In June 2023, Egyptian authorities introduced a new set of foreigner’s entry regulations, following the large number of new arrivals from Sudan in the weeks prior. The new regulations stipulated that all Sudanese, regardless of their age and gender, should obtain a visa prior to entering Egypt. Visa restriction and change of policy by Egyptian consulate hindered the much-needed access to safety for Sudanese, refugees and third country nationals. The visa restriction by Egyptian consulate has created golden opportunity for smugglers and traffickers, and some persons regardless of nationality or legal status have been risking their life to travel to Egypt through illegal route with the support of smugglers. Since children without travel document are prevented from travelling, family separation has also been reported. Also, Tunisia has functioned as a departure and transit point for refugees and asylum-seekers as well as migrants attempting to move onward to Europe in search of effective protection or better opportunities...During 2023, UNHCR registered 361 Sudanese nationals. At the same period in 2022, Sudan was the leading nationality of registration with 1,101 individuals. Following the outbreak of the Sudanese crisis in April 2023, the office closely monitored the registration trends of this population. 30% of Sudanese registered in 2023 left Sudan after the 2023 conflict, and 68% of people registered in 2023 arrived in Morocco in 2023.</p>
          <p>Nearly 6,000 Sudanese arrivals were recorded in Italy last year as compared to 1,000 in 2022. Sudanese refugees in Europe are relatively new and their journeys from Sudan conflict differ from those of more established refugee populations from the Horn of Africa who often have established family and kinship ties in Europe. Hence are susceptible to numerous vulnerabilities. In the region, many Sudanese have sought exile in major cities in Kampala, Nairobi and Addis Ababa</p>
          <p class="text-danger">TODO: Add Map of the movements, including to Uganda, Libya, to the Mediterranean and the middle east</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary">Education</h5>
          <p>The ongoing crisis in Sudan and its impact on neighbouring countries has highlighted the challenges for education systems to respond to emergencies. In Sudan, the government can no longer ensure the regular and timely payment of teacher salaries, even in states unaffected by the conflict. The delay in reopening schools is further compounded by the destruction of education facilities or their occupation by internally displaced people and by the displacement of teachers. Host countries are struggling with their own challenges to provide education to all national students, with high out-of-school rates, often leaving little space and capacity to enroll Sudanese refugee children who have already lost several months of school. So far, the education response in host countries has been limited in scope, focusing on the educational needs of new arrivals, hampered by lack of funding, and unable to address the pre-crisis low enrolment rates for Sudanese refugee children. Some of the gaps apply equally to refugees and nationals, namely insufficient teacher workforce both in terms of number and qualifications as well as inadequate school facilities. In addition, refugee students may have unique needs linked to teaching language and curriculum support to transition from the home to the host country system, and the need for psychosocial support to resume healthy development and learning. In 2024, over one million Sudanese refugee children in the asylum countries will need education. If the levels of funding cannot support the activities beyond what was achieved in 2023, 80 per cent of these children risk remaining out of school.</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary">GBV remains alarming</h5>
          <p>Overall, women and girls account for more than half of all registered refugees from Sudan, although in some host countries the proportion is higher. On top of the inherent dangers posed by conflict and displacement, women and girls have been exposed to shocking levels of sexual violence, whether in conflict-affected areas inside Sudan, on the move, or in countries of asylum. </p>
          <p>In a report on gender-based violence during the crisis published at the end of 2023, UNHCR said women and girls inside Sudan were bearing the brunt of consequences from the conflict, including “alarming” levels of sexual violence. The population movements and humanitarian access within and across the country’s borders have become increasingly complex, thousands of refugee women and girls trapped in Darfur and Kordofan regions are to be considered at heightened risk of all forms of GBV.</p>
          <div style="min-height:237px" class="my-4"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvtEx/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvtEx/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
          <p>Many of those seeking asylum have experienced or witnessed harassment, abduction, rape, sexual assault, sexual exploitation and other forms of violence during their journeys. GBV trends include in particular conflict-related sexual violence, but also intimate partner violence, child marriage and sexual exploitation by community members. GBV remains severely under-reported as survivors are unable to reach services, breakdowns in the telecommunications network due to active hostilities or out of fear of stigma and retaliation.</p>
          <p>The hosting conditions in neighboring countries remain dire. The scarcity of natural resources, the limited infrastructure, essential services and livelihood activities and inflation, have particularly increased the vulnerability of women and girls. The severe underfunding across sectors of the refugee response has created gaps in assistance and service delivery and further heightens the GBV risks including sexual exploitation and the resorting to harmful coping mechanisms at border areas and in the camps.</p>
          <p>UNHCR continues to coordinate GBV in refugee settings, and jointly with its partners, to implement GBV prevention and response programming. This includes lifesaving, survivor-centred GBV response services addressing health- including Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), psychosocial support provided alongside empowerment activities Safe Spaces for Women and girls (SSWG), material assistance, legal awareness to GBV survivors, as well as referral to appropriate services.</p>
          <p>UNHCR will continue its advocacy to enhance the protection of forcibly displaced women and girls in and outside Sudan including in favour of improved access and quality of services.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-5">New arrivals nutrition conditions are worsening</h3>
          <p>In Chad, nearly 50,000 malnourished children have crossed the border.  If we don’t manage to dramatically scale up the response inside Sudan – through cross-border access, cross-line access – we will see more.</p>
          <div style="min-height:664px"  class="my-4"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MwEdh/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MwEdh/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
          <h3 class="mt-5">What are  UNHCR and humanitarian partners</h3>
          <p>Inside Sudan, the ongoing clashes in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Darfur regions have hindered the ability of UNHCR and other agencies to deliver much-needed assistance, although some has been possible with the presence of local staff and partners through cross-border and cross-line movement of relief items. In areas where the security situation permits, such as Gedaref, Kassala, White Nile, and Blue Nile states, UNHCR has strengthened its operations to continue providing protection and assistance to refugees and to respond to new displacement patterns. Additionally, UNHCR has established new offices in Port Sudan, Wad Madani, and Wadi Halfa, where our teams and partners are assisting refugees, internally displaced and other affected Sudanese people. We provide relief items, emergency shelters, cash assistance, and critical services, including education programmes, legal aid for individuals lacking civil documentation, and psychosocial support.</p>

          <p>In neighbouring countries, UNHCR is coordinating the response to the influx of refugees and returnees together with governments, other UN agencies and partners. Our teams have been working around the clock to support new arrivals, set up transit centres where people can rest and receive essential protection services and emergency aid, establish and expand camps and settlements where they can access longer-term support, and facilitate onward transfers away from overcrowded border areas.  We have set up 10 new refugee settlements in Chad, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and South Sudan. Yet with millions who have fled to neighbouring countries or other parts of Sudan in urgent need of help, waning international attention and a chronic lack of funding is hampering the capacity of UNHCR and other organizations to save lives.</p>
