          <p>Since the conflict started in Sudan in April, millions of people have been displaced, seeking safety and humanitarian assistance within the country and across borders into neighboring countries. More than <strong>1&nbsp;million refugees and refugee returnees</strong> have now arrived in the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. With no end in sight to the fighting, this grim milestone is expected to be surpassed as more people continue to flee the country.</p>

          <p>The crisis is desperate. Innocent people, including refugees, have lost their lives, livelihoods and are forced to rely on humanitarian aid to survive. Among the people forced to leave Sudan, it is estimated that 75% are refugees and asylum seekers and 25% are refugee returnees, who had been living in Sudan. These populations are seeking refuge in the neighboring countries which were already hosting thousands of displaced people even before the fighting began in April.</p>

          <p>This crisis has made an already very challenging humanitarian situation in the country even more complex. Prior to the crisis, nearly 16 million people in Sudan were in need of aid due to years of conflict and the impacts of climate change through flooding.  </p>
          <p>In response to this escalating crisis, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and partners have scaled up efforts to address the needs of displaced populations inside and outside of Sudan. We are working closely with the government, other UN agencies, humanitarian partners and host communities to ensure the provision of emergency shelter, clean water, health care services, psychosocial support and other vital assistance. Here are the stories of some of the people behind the numbers:</p>

          <p>“Eliza James, 41, sits with her 4-month-old son Teny, at the UNHCR transit centre near the Joda border point in Renk, South Sudan. With her husband staying in Khartoum, Eliza and her four children spent four days travelling from the city to the border with South Sudan. Two of those days were spent in the bush without food or water, while hiding from fighting on the road ahead. Eliza is from Bentiu and fled to Sudan in 2013 when the civil war began. Eliza says of her situation, "There was nothing to do but leave [Khartoum], the fighting was everywhere. I packed some bags and ran with my neighbours. We stayed 2 days in the bush and it was so scary, at least here we are safe. There is nothing to do, this is our life as South Sudanese. I am happy to return to Bentiu, it is my home."</p>

          <p>Najua Ismail Abdalla (in the middle) is an 18-year-old refugee from Kanga, Sudan. She is in Arkoum refugee camp in Chad with her mother, but her father is still in Sudan. In her hometown, she used to make and sell bean patties, so she continued her small business after settling in the camp. Her friends are also from Kanga. Samina Ibrahim Sarif (the one wearing a light blue hijab) is 19 years old and has come to the camp with her sister. She is waiting for her parents to be relocated there so that the family can be reunited. The youngest of the group, Islam Juma (the one wearing a black hijab), is 13 years old. In Sudan, she was attending the sixth grade and now she hopes to go back to school.</p>

          <p>The forced displacement of Sudanese and others from Sudan shows no signs of slowing down. With over 1 million forced to cross international borders, it is time for the world to act now and ensure that the vulnerable populations forced to flee their homes are protected and their rights respected.</p>
